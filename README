Description: 
Simple stream log based in web2py code framework. The app use streaming Comet, this opens a single persistent connection from the client browser to the server 
for all Comet events.

The configuration is really easy. We only need to add logs in /etc/streamlog.cfg, for example:

		[logs]
		syslog=/var/log/syslog
		apache-vhost-shop=/var/log/apache/shop-access.log
		

How to install in Linux:

1- Download the script install.sh
	#wget https://github.com/downloads/josedesoto/serverStreamLog/install.sh
	
2- As a root user:
	#chmod 755 install.sh
	#./install.sh
	
3- Add some log in /etc/streamlog.cfg to create streaming
	
4- Start the service
	#/etc/init.d/streamlogd
		
		

Install a client to read the logs:
